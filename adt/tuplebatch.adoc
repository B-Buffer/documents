image:img/tuplebatch.png[ADT - TupleBatch]

* A `TupleBatch` is a matrix data set,  it equivalent to a set of rows in RDBMS Table.
* A `TupleBatch` represents a set of indexed link:tuple.adoc[tuples] and is a segment of link:tuplesource.adoc[tuple source].
* A `TupleBatch` has 2 key flag represents it's position of the whole link:tuplesource.adoc[tuple source]:
** rowOffset - is the first row contained in this batch, if it equals "1" then it is the first row of the tuple source, otherwise this is a batch of intermediate tuples.
** terminationFlag - whether the batch is the last batch of the whole link:tuplesource.adoc[tuple source],  if it equals "1" then it means the batch is the last batch.
